=== Custom upload types

If you need to handle different types of uploads, since version 3.4.0, you can simply define a new block into the upload section:

[source, groovy]
----
...
upload {
	...

	avatar {
	    browser = true
	    upload = true
	    allowed = ['gif', 'jpg']
	    denied = ['exe', 'sh', 'cgi']
	}

	...
}

...
----
