=== Current version

[NOTE]
====
The versioning model has changed. Since version 3.3.2 the version number of the plugin will reflect the one of the underline integrated CKeditor library.
If necessary a 4th level point release number will be used for successive changes on the plugin's code with same version of CKeditor.

Eg.
|===
| CKeditor release | Initial plugin version | Maintenance release
| 3.3.2            | 3.3.2.0                | 3.3.2.1
| 3.4              | 3.4.0                  | 3.4.0.1
| 3.6.6.1          | 3.6.6.1.0              | 3.6.6.1.1
